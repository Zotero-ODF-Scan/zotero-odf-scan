 Bootstrap version, initial code. Translator does not yet install, but plugin seems to work smoothly.

 test for presence of Scannable Cite translator to set Pref. We might just go ahead and skip the pref?

 update version number and fix include so that Zotero gets defined first

 install Scannable Cite translator on install and initialize translators so it works immediately. Set a pref so we only do this once. @fbennett - have a look, I think this was really the last step we needed to make this foolproof, so I'm excited to have it running, but I'm very inexperienced with this - first time I'm touching an add-on - so it'd be nice if you could make sure that I'm not doing anything foolish. I'm not attached to any of the labels, so if anything bothers you, just fix it.
