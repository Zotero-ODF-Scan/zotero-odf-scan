    <h1>RTF/ODF Scan for Zotero</h1>
    <p>
      This plugin is a companion to Zotero (or Multilingual Zotero)
      that adds the ability to convert Scannable Cite markers in an
      ODF document (the native format of LibreOffice) to
      fully functional Zotero citations. Conversion works in both
      directions, and documents can contain a mixture of Scannable
      Cite markers and "live" Zotero citations. Conversion will
      transform all cites in the document to the selected form.
      When converting to live citations, adjacent markers will
      be merged into "multiple" Zotero citations.
