A note-to-self on conversion checks to do before the next release.

(1) Start with a document containing one of each of:

  - A native citation from My Library;
  - A native citation from a group;
  - A zotero://select text marker from My Library;
  - A zotero://select text marker from a group;
  - A prefixed text marker from My Library;
  - A prefixed text marker from a group.

(2) Convert the document "to markers" and check the output.
(3) Convert the document "to citations" and check the output.
(4) Reverse-convert the "to citations" version and check the output.
